## Sprints
### Sprint01
Sprint #1: The purpose of sprint #1 is not about how much code you get done, it's about conceptually understanding the ins and outs of how to complete a sprint, and how to work together with your development and client teams to overcome errors when they arise. Goal In order for the kiosk class to work, there must be a library of movies. In order to have a library of movies to select from, the movie class must be fleshed out. Therefore, we are starting with the movie and library classes for sprint 1.
